I hope you like shark facts.

This project was made by request by some kids I know who share my enthusiasm for sharks, so it's intended for a younger audience.

My approach was to create something that worked, simply and logically, that would be easy for kids to see and use.

Used a pretty simple for loop to display Q+As; I'd planned to write more questions but in the given time, writing that much copy was taking forever and I found that more complex questions didn't format well and testers did not like reading through answers more than about five words long.

Unsolved problems included not getting "x questions out of 16" to change to "question" after the first correct answer had been chosen. I also was not able to incorporate photos into the arrays when I'd hoped to ask questions about identifying species based on appearance.

Styling the radio buttons was basically impossible, which was frustrating to learn once I got to my styling phase, which was last.
